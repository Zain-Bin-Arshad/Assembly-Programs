### Assembly Programs

These are various basic program that I built using **8086 emulator**.

To be frank I don't actually remember which program does what, as you know how difficult is *assembly language* when it comes to understanding what is going on in the code.

Given program does following things:

- Inverse Input e.g. "Python is great" -> "taerg si nohtyP "
- Inverse input but keep the words in same order e.g. "Python is great" -> "great is Python"
- Product of array values 
- Decimal I/O
- Factorial
- Fibonacci numbers
- Case converter
- Palindrome
- String operations 
- Draw line on screen
- Change cursor color
etc...
